As a general rule,
if you have an object in Python,

sam and want to convert to that type of objectcall type(my_object) on it. The result can usually
sam lorem i√•som be called as a function to do the conversion.For
 instance type(100) results in int, so you can call
 sam int(my_object) to try convert my_object to an integer. This doesn't always work, but is a good "first
sam int(my_object) to try convert my_object
sam int(my_object) to try convert my_object
sam int(my_object) to try convert my_object
